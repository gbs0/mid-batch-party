## Welcome to the first Hunger 'Mid Batch Party' Wagon Game!

#### This repo was created for fun and code purposes (:

Here are the challenges:

#### • First Challenge:
> Create a function (or write a script in Shell) that takes an integer as an argument and returns "Even" for even numbers or "Odd" for odd numbers.

#### • Second Challenge:
> You get an array of numbers, return the sum of all of the positives ones.

> Example `[1,-4,7,12]` => 1 + 7 + 12 = 20

> Note: if there is nothing to sum, the sum is default to 0.

#### • Third Challenge:
> Return the number (count) of vowels in the given string.

> We will consider a, e, i, o, and u as vowels for this challenge.

> The input string will only consist of lower case letters and/or spaces.

#### Fourth Challenge:
> In this challenge you will create a function that takes a list of non-negative integers and strings and returns a new list with the strings filtered out.

> #### Example: 

> `` filter_list([1,2,'a','b']) == [1,2]
filter_list([1,'a','b',0,15]) == [1,0,15]
filter_list([1,2,'aasf','1','123',123]) == [1,2,123] ``

#### Fifth Challenge:
> Very simple challenge, given a number, find its opposite!

> #### Examples:

> ``1: -1
14: -14
-34: 34``

#### Sixth Challenge:
> This time no story, no theory. The examples below show you how to write function accum:

#### Examples:
> ``accum("abcd") -> "A-Bb-Ccc-Dddd"
accum("RqaEzty") -> "R-Qq-Aaa-Eeee-Zzzzz-Tttttt-Yyyyyyy"
accum("cwAt") -> "C-Ww-Aaa-Tttt"
The parameter of accum is a string which includes only letters from a..z and A..Z.``

#### •Seventh Challenge:

> Complete the method/function so that it converts dash/underscore delimited words into camel casing. The first word within the output should be capitalized *only* if the original word was capitalized.

> #### Examples: 
``to_camel_case("the-stealth-warrior") # returns "theStealthWarrior"
to_camel_case("The_Stealth_Warrior") # returns "TheStealthWarrior"
``

#### Eight Challenge:
> Make a program that filters a list of strings and returns a list with only your friends name in it.

> If a name has exactly 4 letters in it, you can be sure that it has to be a friend of yours! Otherwise, you can be sure he's not...

> #### Example:

``Input = ["Ryan", "Kieran", "Jason", "Yous"], Output = ["Ryan", "Yous"]``

> Note: keep the original order of the names in the output.
